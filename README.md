## Project Summary
```In this project I am creating a job Search Portal with some validations, Custom queries,custom Finders and enum datatype. Here we can perform  some basics CRUD operations like add job and check data is inserted or not. we can also update the informtion of job and also we can check the data is valid or not . we can delete the job by their Id where id is Primary key. And we can get infomation of job here we find any specific user by Id or we can find the all user's list.```
